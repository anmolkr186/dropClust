# dropClust
This is the implementation of dropClust - a clustering algorithm for droplet single cell RNA seq data. This algorithm has been built upon the research in the following paper:


Debajyoti Sinha, Akhilesh Kumar, Himanshu Kumar, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay, Debarka Sengupta, dropClust: efficient clustering of ultra-large scRNA-seq data, Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 46, Issue 6, 6 April 2018, Page e36, [https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky007] (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky007)

The original implementation of the algorithm has been done in R. As a part of Algorithms in Computational Biology Course, we were assigned to make the Python implementation of the algorithms (by Dr. Debarka Sengupta, an author of this paper)

## How to run:
- Download the repository and run it in Anaconda Jupyter Enviroment.
- You can also upload the repo to Google Colab.
- Run temp.iynb file with the necessary inputs.
